# board-game

The board has a fixed size of 5 squares (assume it is always square). 
∙ The piece can move around the board in one of four directions ((N)orth, (E)ast, (S)outh and  (W)est). 
∙ The piece will start in the bottom left corner of the board facing North. 
∙ The bottom left board square is indicated by the position 0 0, top left corner of the board is 0 4, bottom right is 4 0 and top right is therefore 4 4. 
∙ If you try to make a move that would result in the piece moving off the board the move will have no effect. For example moving North when you are already at the top of the board. You can assume that the input is always correct.
